# parallel-computing
A repo of the microprojects during the course CS F422 Parallel Computing.

I worked on project [A1-P1](https://github.com/harshitgarg22/parallel-computing/tree/main/Assignment_1/P1) and [A2-P2](https://github.com/harshitgarg22/parallel-computing/tree/main/Assignment_2/P2).

A1-P1 deals with implementing parallel searching in a text corpus for boolean queries using MPI.

A2-P2 deals with implementing hyperquicksort for an array using OpenMP.

All programming was done in C.
